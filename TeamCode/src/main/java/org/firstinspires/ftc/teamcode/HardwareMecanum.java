/*
 * This file works in conjunction with the External Hardware Class sample called: ConceptExternalHardwareClass.java
 * Please read the explanations in that Sample about how to use this class definition.
 *
 * This file defines a Java Class that performs all the setup and configuration for a sample robot's hardware (motors and sensors).
 * It assumes three motors (left_drive, right_drive and arm) and two servos (left_hand and right_hand)
 *
 * This one file/class can be used by ALL of your OpModes without having to cut & paste the code each time.
 *
 * Where possible, the actual hardware objects are "abstracted" (or hidden) so the OpMode code just makes calls into the class,
 * rather than accessing the internal hardware directly. This is why the objects are declared "private".
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with *exactly the same name*.
 *
 * Or... In OnBot Java, add a new file named RobotHardware.java, select this sample, and select Not an OpMode.
 * Also add a new OpMode, select the sample ConceptExternalHardwareClass.java, and select TeleOp.
